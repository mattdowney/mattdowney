Hey there, I'm Matt. I'm a designer, founder, and entrepreneur based in ATL.

For more than a decade, I ran [45royale](https://45royale.com/)—a digital design agency I founded in 2005. I led a remote team of creative experts who built sites and apps for design-minded companies like [@articulate](https://github.com/articulate), [@mailchimp](https://github.com/mailchimp), [@microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft), [@uber](https://github.com/uber), and more.

Now, I teach, tinker, and build products for myself and my friends.
